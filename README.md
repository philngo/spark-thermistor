Spark Thermistor
================

Thermistors have different resistances under different temperature conditions,
but not linearly. Equations modelling the temperature-dependent resistance of
thermistors often have the form of the Steinhartâ€“Hart equation.

This repository contains code that will allow you to find the appropriate
parameters for calibrating a thermistor for accurate temperature sensing. It
also contains a simple app for reading temperature and resistance values from
a spark core or photon.
